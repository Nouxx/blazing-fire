# Git workflow

Following the principles of _"trunk-based development"_, all codebase modifications are merged incrementally into the `main` branch (the trunk).

To maintain a production-ready state, every change is integrated through pull requests and CI is making sure the change can be safely deployed.

The semantic details is explained in more details [here](git-semantic.md).

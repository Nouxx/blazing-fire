# :fire: Web Application

:desktop_computer: Web Application developed with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev).

:bust_in_silhouette: User Authentication and Database powered by [Supabase](https://supabase.com)

## Developing

### Supabase local environment

Docker is necessary! :whale:

```bash
pnpm supa:start
```

### Setup .env file

Create a `.env` file in this directory with the values specified in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

The `anon` and `service role` keys from your local Supabase environment are required. They can be found by running:

```bash
pnpm supabase status
```

### Build & serve

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Testing

Made with Playwright and heavily relying on [visual snapshot comparaison](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots).

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:e2e -u # for --update-snapshots
```

## Deploying

The application is deployed within [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

Refer to the [workflow documentation](../../README.md) for more information.

## Update Supabase project

Pre requisite: have the supabase project linked.

```bash
pnpm supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
```

Check migration status on the remote project

```bash
pnpm supabase migrations list
```

Push local migrations to remote

```bash
pnpm supabase db push
```

## DB

### Dump local DB

Dump the current local DB state into the `supabase/seed.sql` file

```bash
docker compose exec db ./scripts/db-dump.sh
```

This is run inside the Docker container db without the `supabase db dump` command since the latter require a Docker daemon because it 
needs to remove the container supposedly started with `supabase start`. It's possible to use it and connect to the local DB but only
outside of Docker, which, in some cases might not work because `node_modules` dependencies are installed via Docker (the dev container).
These extra steps are unfortunately necessary to have a more reliable experience.

## Reset local DB

Resetting the local DB will wipe out everything and restore it data from the `seed.sql` file (generated by the dump)

```bash
docker compose down -v # removes the db container and the db data volume
docker compose up -d --wait
docker compose run --rm dev npm run db:reset
```
